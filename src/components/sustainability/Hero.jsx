                The Club supports a broad sustainability programme both on site and in its outreach. 
                During a difficult year in 2020, due to the pandemic resulting in a national lockdown, 
                our programme successfully expanded to include meals prepared by our furloughed chefs for 
                donation to the Felix Project, Londonâ€™s charity against food waste and hunger. In addition to this, 
                the Club ran a successful food box campaign, 
                putting together and delivering over 700 food boxes to vulnerable members of our community.
